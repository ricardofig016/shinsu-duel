# Shinsu Duel: A Tower of God CCG

Shinsu Duel is a 1vs1 collectible card game (CCG) inspired by SIU's _Tower of God_. The game offers both Player vs. Player (PvP) and Campaign (PvE) modes. Players strategize by building decks, deploying units, and using abilities to destroy their opponentâ€™s lighthouses while protecting their own.

## Game Logic

Below is an in-depth explanation on how the `GameState` class handles each game.

### User Actions

The player may use certain actions, such as deploying a unit, using an ability, or passing the turn. `GameState` redirects these action request to their respective `ActionHandler` (`DeployUnitAction`, `UseAbilityAction`, `PassTurnAction`). `GameState` asks the handler to validate the action request, and then to execute it, performing the necessary changes.
